## 3. Sample Abstract Content

### Problem Statement – Motivation

The Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally transformed how individuals, industries, and governments interact with digital systems by enabling large-scale interconnection of devices, sensors, and services. While this paradigm shift has improved efficiency, automation, and data-driven decision-making, it has also introduced significant security and privacy challenges.

### Research Gap – Conflict

Many IoT devices operate under strict resource constraints, are deployed in heterogeneous environments, and rely on poorly standardized communication protocols, making them particularly vulnerable to attacks such as spoofing, unauthorized access, and malicious behavior.

### Literature Review – Incomplete or failed attempts

Existing lightweight security mechanisms often fail to provide sufficient protection, while more robust cryptographic and authentication solutions introduce unacceptable computational overhead, latency, and energy consumption. This unresolved tension exposes a gap in current approaches to securing constrained IoT devices without compromising their operational efficiency.

### Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to evaluate existing IoT security frameworks, identify limitations in protecting resource-constrained devices, and design a balanced security solution that enhances both robustness and efficiency. Specifically, this project aims to develop a hybrid security model that integrates lightweight authentication mechanisms with intelligent anomaly detection.

### Methodology

The proposed methodology involves a comparative analysis of existing IoT security techniques, followed by the design of a Bayesian Network-based hybrid framework. This framework will model device behavior probabilistically to detect anomalies while maintaining low computational overhead. Performance, scalability, and security effectiveness will be evaluated through simulation and experimental analysis.

### Impact – Contributions

The expected contributions of this research include improved security resilience for IoT systems and practical deployment guidance for critical domains such as healthcare and smart cities, where reliability, privacy, and performance are paramount.

### Key Words

Internet of Things, Detection Accuracy, Performance Overhead, Bayesian Network

> Note: This abstract will be used to guide project proposals, assign supervisors, and prepare for the Capstone Showcase. Clarity, completeness, and proper formatting are crucial.

## A Resource Constrained Intrusion Detection Technique for Internet of Things

**Abstract** - The Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally transformed how individuals, industries, and governments interact with digital systems by enabling large-scale interconnection of devices, sensors, and services.

This unresolved tension exposes a gap in current approaches to securing constrained IoT devices without compromising their operational efficiency.
